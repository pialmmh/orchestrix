# Future Chat UI Requirements for Device Management

## Overview
Multi-device chat interface for network device configuration and management through AI assistants.

## Core Features

### 1. Device Selection & Connection
- **Multi-device selection**: Checkbox interface for selecting multiple SSH/Telnet enabled devices
- **Connection validation**: Connect to all selected devices before proceeding
- **Error handling**: Show connection errors and prevent continuation if any device fails
- **Connection status**: Real-time status indicators for each device
- **Device types supported**: Initially SSH, expandable to Telnet, Serial

### 2. AI Assistant Integration  
- **Multiple AI providers**: ChatGPT, Claude AI, and other providers
- **AI selection**: User selects preferred chat agent before starting session
- **Context awareness**: AI assistant has full context of all connected devices
- **Command execution**: AI can send commands to specific devices through chat interface

### 3. Chat Interface
- **Real-time chat**: WebSocket-based chat interface with AI assistant
- **Device context**: AI understands which devices are available and their capabilities
- **Command targeting**: Ability to send commands to specific devices or broadcast to all
- **Command history**: Track all commands sent to devices
- **Response aggregation**: Collect and display responses from multiple devices

### 4. Device Management
- **Session management**: Maintain persistent connections during chat session
- **Concurrent operations**: Handle multiple device operations simultaneously
- **Error recovery**: Reconnection attempts and graceful error handling
- **Security**: Secure credential management and encrypted connections

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components
- **TerminalDevice Interface**: Abstract interface for all device types
- **SshDevice Class**: SSH implementation of TerminalDevice
- **TelnetDevice Class**: Future Telnet implementation
- **SerialDevice Class**: Future Serial implementation
- **DeviceManager Service**: Connection and session management
- **ChatService**: AI integration and message routing
- **CommandExecutor**: Command dispatch and response collection

### Frontend Components
- **Device Selection Panel**: Multi-select interface with connection status
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time messaging with AI assistant
- **Command Console**: Direct command interface for advanced users
- **Device Status Dashboard**: Connection and health monitoring

### Database Schema
- **devices**: Device inventory and connection details
- **chat_sessions**: Chat session management
- **commands**: Command history and audit trail
- **device_responses**: Response logging and analysis

## Current Implementation Priority
1. **TerminalDevice Interface** - Abstract device communication
2. **SshDevice Implementation** - SSH-based device management
3. **DeviceManager Service** - Connection and session management
4. **Basic command execution framework**

## Future Enhancements
- **Telnet and Serial device support**
- **Device configuration templates**
- **Automated device discovery**
- **Role-based access control**
- **Command scheduling and automation**
- **Device performance monitoring**
- **Configuration backup and restore**
