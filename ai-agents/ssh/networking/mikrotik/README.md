## How to Use This Agent

### Prerequisites

1. **Start Orchestrix Backend**
```bash
cd /home/mustafa/telcobright-projects/orchestrix
mvn spring-boot:run
```

2. **Verify Router Access**
- Ensure routers are reachable via SSH
- Confirm credentials are available in environment
- Check network connectivity

### Method 1: Direct Agent Session (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/mustafa/telcobright-projects/orchestrix/ai-agents/ssh/networking/mikrotik
claude-code
```

### Method 2: Reference from Any Session
```bash
claude-code
# Then in session:
"Please act as the MikroTik agent defined in ai-agents/ssh/networking/mikrotik/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md"
```

### Method 3: From Main Directory
```bash
cd /home/mustafa/telcobright-projects/orchestrix
claude-code --agent ai-agents/ssh/networking/mikrotik
```

## Router Infrastructure

- **Access**: SSH port 22
- **Authentication**: admin credentials from environment
- **Certificates**: Auto-accepted for development

## Usage Examples

### Getting Started
```
Agent: Connect to smsmk01 and show me the current system status and network overview
```

Expected response: Connection status, system resources, interface overview, routing table summary

### Interface Management
```
Agent: Show me all interfaces on smsmk01 and their current status
Agent: Enable interface ether2 on smsmk01
Agent: Configure IP address 192.168.10.1/24 on ether1 of smsmk01
```

### Multi-Router Operations
```
Agent: Show interface status across all connected routers
Agent: Get system identity from all routers
Agent: Compare routing tables between smsmk01 and smsmk02
```

### Routing Configuration
```
Agent: Configure OSPF area 0 for network 192.168.1.0/24 on smsmk01
Agent: Add static route to 10.0.0.0/8 via 192.168.1.254 on smsmk01
Agent: Show me all OSPF neighbors across the network
```

### Firewall Management
```
Agent: Show current firewall rules on smsmk01
Agent: Add NAT masquerading rule for 192.168.1.0/24 network on smsmk01
Agent: Create firewall rule to allow SSH from 192.168.100.0/24
```

### System Administration
```
Agent: Create a backup of smsmk01 configuration
Agent: Show system resource usage on all routers
Agent: Check system logs for any errors on smsmk01
```

### Monitoring and Diagnostics
```
Agent: Monitor interface traffic on ether1 of smsmk01
Agent: Test connectivity to 8.8.8.8 from smsmk01
Agent: Show DHCP client leases on all routers
```

## Backend Integration

### Java Services Used
- **DeviceManager**: Multi-router connection management
- **MikroTikService**: RouterOS-specific operations
- **REST API**: Device and command endpoints

### Available Endpoints
- `POST /api/devices/connect` - Connect to router
- `POST /api/devices/command` - Execute command on specific router
- `POST /api/devices/broadcast` - Execute command on all routers
- `GET /api/devices/status` - Get connection status
- `GET /api/mikrotik/{deviceId}/interfaces` - Get interface information
- `POST /api/mikrotik/{deviceId}/command` - Execute custom RouterOS command

## Safety Features

### Built-in Protections
- Configuration backup before major changes
- Connectivity verification after modifications
- Error handling and rollback procedures
- Change documentation and audit trails

### Best Practices Enforced
- Always verify commands before execution
- Test in development before production
- Monitor network impact of changes
- Maintain configuration consistency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Failures**
- Check if Orchestrix backend is running
- Verify router IP addresses and SSH connectivity
- Confirm credentials are correct

**Command Execution Errors**
- Verify RouterOS command syntax
- Check user permissions on router
- Ensure router resources are sufficient

**Response Parsing Issues**
- RouterOS version compatibility
- Command output format changes
- Network timeout problems

### Getting Help
1. Check agent logs for detailed error messages
2. Test basic connectivity with simple commands
3. Verify router configuration and access
4. Review RouterOS documentation for command syntax

## Advanced Features

### Network Topology Awareness
- Understands router relationships and roles
- Maintains configuration consistency across devices
- Coordinates changes to prevent network disruption
