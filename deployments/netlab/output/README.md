# Netlab Automation Output

This directory contains generated configuration files and outputs from deployment automations.

## WireGuard VPN Client Configs

Generated client configurations for remote access to the netlab overlay network (10.9.9.0/24) and container subnets (10.10.0.0/16).

### Client Naming Convention

```
client1.conf    # Link3 office
client2.conf    # BDCOM server
client3.conf    # Developer workstation 1
client4.conf    # Developer workstation 2
...
clientN.conf    # Additional clients as needed
```

### Usage

```bash
# Copy to client machine
scp output/client1.conf user@client-machine:/etc/wireguard/netlab.conf

# Or use directly
wg-quick up output/client1.conf
```

### Client Config Structure

Each client config includes:
- Client private key and address (10.9.9.100+/32)
- Server public key and endpoint
- Allowed IPs: 10.9.9.0/24, 10.10.0.0/16
- Persistent keepalive for NAT traversal

## Other Outputs

Additional automation outputs will be organized in subdirectories:

```
output/
├── client1.conf              # WireGuard client configs
├── client2.conf
├── bgp-topology.txt          # Generated BGP topology
├── deployment-summary.txt    # Last deployment summary
└── logs/                     # Deployment logs (optional)
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Client configs contain private keys - treat as secrets!**

- Do NOT commit client configs to version control
- Use secure transfer methods (scp, encrypted channels)
- Rotate keys if compromised
- Delete old configs after key rotation
